# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thanks a lot for helping to keep open source secure and useful for many developers! 

In case you found a vulnerability, please follow following steps to report any security issue.

- Create an issue on GitHub without any details on the bug itself, use something like **Possible vulnerability found, please contact me**

Working on the issue we move all following communication to a draft security advisory. This is to hide the vulnerability from public.

- We will create a draft security advisory and invite you as a collaborator.
- Add a comment to the draft security advisory with a detailed description of the vulnerability (include all of the following details in your description)
   - Platform used, for example: Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Standard, x64, IIS 8
   - Exact command used to build AjaxPro, or if you were taking a release package
   - Attach a screen shot of the crash
   - Attach a proof-of-concept that shows reproducable the issue
   - The source location of the bug and/or any other information that you are able to provide about what the cause of the bug is.
- We will work together with you to reproduce the issue on our side and prepare a fix shortly

The draft security advisory is private until we publish it, so it is a good place to discuss the details of the vulnerability privately.

To qualify as a security issue, the bug must be reproducible on an official release of AjaxPro. Official releases are listed here (https://github.com/michaelschwarz/Ajax.NET-Professional/releases), not including those labeled "pre-release". Bugs that are only reproducible on the main branch or on a pre-release are not security issues and can be reported as regular issues.
